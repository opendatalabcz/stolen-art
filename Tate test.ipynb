Znamená to, že namatchuje pouze body, které jsou si nejpodobnější navzájem, tzn. pro žádný z dvojice neexistuje v druhém obraze lepší match. Pokud ho dám na False, matcher namatchuje všechny body a výsledek je uplně k ničemu. Pokud na true, matcher namatchuje cca polovinu bodů, ale u všech obrazů a je proto taky k ničemu.\n",
