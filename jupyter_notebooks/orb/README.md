# Testing the ORB algorithm

This directory contains jupyter notebooks where I tested the ORB algorithm before I decided to use it and implement it on the server. 

See the ORB_Tate notebook, others are experimental. The notebook contains methods for visualisation optimalization so the notebook does not crash when displaying large images. 

## Usage

1. Set the stolen_art_dir_path and found_paintings_dir_path variables to contain the paths to painting directories.
    - The first directory should contain stolen paintings (user taken) and the second one contains found painting (the paintings in the database).
2. If you want to visualize matches, set draw_match to True.


The notebook contains an example of usage, it uses directories containing approx. 10 paintings just for demonstration purposes.
