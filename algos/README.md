# ORB testing

This notebook simulates searching for a painting in a database.

## Test data

For this notebook I took pictures of several paintings from different angles and various light conditions. 

Paintings in "mydata-found" are considered found paintings (paintings we want to search in the database). 
Paintings in "mydata-stolen" are considered stolen paintings (paintings in the database).


# Steps

For each found painting, search the database for a best match and display the result.
